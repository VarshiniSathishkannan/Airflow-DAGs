3 core components:
1. web server
2. scheduler
3. metadata database

others
4. executor
5. worker

3 ways of interacting with Airflow
1. UI
2. Command Line Interface
3. Rest API

The effective DAG run starts after start date + schedule interval

start date - required field if task is present
schedule_interval default - 24hrs
execution date
end date 

if start date is in the past, then airflow triggers all the non triggered instance between the start and current date at the same time. We will end up with many dag instances running simultaneously.
this can be disables by catchup set to false 

schedule_interval :

cron expression - absolute 
timedelta function - relative 
@daily, @weekly
None - can only manually trigger the DAG

XComs - cross communication, sharing data between tasks
